# Diabetes-prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on a dataset, likely the well-known Pima Indians Diabetes Database or a similar CSV file. The project implements several popular classification algorithms, addresses feature scaling, handles imbalanced datasets, and performs hyperparameter tuning.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language used for the entire project.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn:** A comprehensive machine learning library in Python, used for:
    * Logistic Regression
    * StandardScaler (for feature scaling)
    * Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)
    * Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
    * Decision Tree
    * Random Forest
    * GridSearchCV (for hyperparameter tuning)
    * `train_test_split` (for data splitting)
    * Evaluation metrics (accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix)
* **Imbalanced-learn (`imblearn`):** For handling imbalanced datasets using:
    * SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
    * RandomOverSampler
* **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** For data visualization (likely used for confusion matrices and potentially other exploratory data analysis).

## Project Structure

The project likely consists of a Python script (or potentially multiple scripts/notebooks) that performs the following steps:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:** Reads the diabetes CSV file using Pandas and likely performs some initial exploration of the data.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * **Feature Scaling:** Applies `StandardScaler` to normalize numerical features.
    * **Data Splitting:** Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.
3.  **Model Implementation and Evaluation:**
    * **Logistic Regression:** Trains and evaluates a Logistic Regression model.
    * **Regularized Logistic Regression (Ridge and Lasso):** Trains and evaluates Logistic Regression with L1 and L2 regularization.
    * **Decision Tree:** Trains and evaluates a Decision Tree classifier.
    * **Random Forest:** Trains and evaluates a Random Forest classifier.
4.  **Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV:**
    * Applies `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model using cross-validation.
5.  **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
    * **Oversampling:** Implements SMOTE and RandomOverSampler on the training data.
    * **Evaluation after Oversampling:** Retrains and evaluates models (likely Decision Tree and/or Random Forest) on the oversampled data.
6.  **Model Comparison:** Compares the performance of all trained models using evaluation metrics and confusion matrices.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * Install the required libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
        ```
2.  **Data:**
    * Ensure you have the diabetes dataset CSV file (e.g., `diabetes.csv`) in the same directory as the Python script or provide the correct path.
3.  **Execution:**
    * Run the Python script.

## Results and Conclusion

Based on the confusion matrices generated during the evaluation, the **Logistic Regression model** emerged as the best-performing model for this diabetes prediction task. While other models like Decision Tree and Random Forest were also explored, and techniques for handling imbalanced data (SMOTE and RandomOverSampler) were applied, Logistic Regression demonstrated the most favorable balance of precision and recall across both classes, leading to the most reliable predictions as visualized in its confusion matrix. The regularization techniques (Ridge and Lasso) applied to Logistic Regression likely contributed to its robustness and ability to generalize well to the unseen test data.

## Further Improvements

* Exploring more advanced feature engineering techniques.
* Trying other classification models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting).
* Further tuning of hyperparameters with wider search spaces.
* Investigating different imbalanced data handling strategies.
* Analyzing feature importance to gain insights into the factors driving diabetes prediction.
